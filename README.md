## Before you run the app:

Make sure Node.js is installed on your computer. You can check it by running:

`node -v`

If no version is provided, please follow the instructions on [https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

## To run the app:

Copy the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/FilipHalon/company-info.git`

Go to the newly created directory by running:

`cd company-info`

Once in the directory, run:

`npm install`

It will automatically install all the required dependencies to run the app. Once it is done, proceed by running:

`npm start`

Your default browser will open and you will find the app running in a new tab. If you close the tab or if you want to run the app in the browser of your choosing instead of the default one, you can enter [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or click the link) into the address bar and the app will launch as long as the server is running.
